👋 Howdy ❕
======

My name's Jake and I live in Atlanta.  I've been writing code since I was pretty young; I've mostly focused on web and iOS apps but I'm always looking to expand my horizons. 

Please feel free to check out [my web site](https://www.jakeconley.com) - it has a more complete bio and presentable list of projects, and I've recently started a blog on there too. 
You can contact me at [jake@jakeconley.com](mailto:jake@jakeconley.com)! 


🧑🏻‍💼 I'm looking for a job!

If you're looking for a passionate, meticulous, effective leader or developer to work with any of the below technologies, I just might be your guy 😉 


😺 Things I do
---

### 😎 My favorites:

 - Back-end web development, especially in Rust 🦀
 - Native iOS development with Swift
 - Front-end web development, mostly with React but I am picking up alternatives
 - General cloud architecture and development 

### 💪 I'm also decent at: 

 - Back-end web development with Go and Ruby 
 - DevOps and CI stuff 

### 🍄 Other interests:

 - 🦀 Fun Rust stuff such as 
   - Embedded systems
   - GUI frameworks 
   - Cross-platform development with technologies like [swift-bridge](https://github.com/chinedufn/swift-bridge); 
     this allows you to easily create a unified core software package in Rust and build your UI separately on top of that. 
     For example, I believe 1Password does something like this. My next cross-platform application will certainly have a native UI running on top of a Rust core. 
 - Game development 
 - Cryptography
